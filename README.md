This repo contain pytorch implementation of Lightweight convolution transformer for cross-patient seizure detection in multi-channel EEG signals as explained in the [Lightweight convolution transformer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107856) paper. This Transformer architecture is inspired from the compact convolution Transformer [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704) and modified for processing the multichannel EEG signals.![](model.png)
